Project Name
    Patient Referral Website

Introduction

    Introducing a project that aims to make healthcare more accessible, I present an innovative solution that caters to the needs of health service providers. Created with utmost dedication, this platform was meticulously designed to simplify the arduous task of locating referral institutions offering higher level care. As the sole contributor to this project, my personal focus has been on developing a seamless and user-friendly interface, ensuring that health service providers can effortlessly search for institutions that align with their patients' specific health requirements. With this undertaking, my purpose is to empower healthcare professionals by streamlining the referral process, ultimately enhancing patient care and fostering collaboration within the healthcare community.

    As a medical doctor, I have witnessed patients and even fellow doctors express concern about the availability of targeted treatments. Our platform brings service providers and clients together, providing a centralized location for all parties to connect and collaborate.

    The development of the patient referral flask website was almost fully completed, with the remaining tasks expected to be finished in the near future. Progress was being tracked through a Trello board and its corresponding deadlines. A mysql database has been integrated into the project using sqlalchemy, which enhanced the storage and retrieval of hospital and service data. The final steps of integrating the data elements and deploying the website after thorough testing, ensuring effective communication with the database and resolving any issues or bugs were also undertaken. 


Techical
    Throughout this whole process, I learned a multitude of valuable skills and lessons. Firstly, I gained familiarity and proficiency in multiple programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, which are essential for working on a patient referral website with project updates. Additionally, I developed expertise in backend development using Flask, a powerful web framework. Moreover, I discovered the benefits of utilizing Flask's built-in template engine, as it allows for easy rendering of dynamic user interfaces without relying on popular front-end frameworks like React or Angular. Furthermore, I gained expertise in database management with MySQL and learned how to integrate SQLAlchemy, a powerful toolkit, to simplify database interactions and enhance code maintainability. I also developed skills in error handling and exception management, which are crucial for robust applications. Additionally, through collaboration and version control, I acquired the ability to effectively work as part of a team and manage different versions of the codebase. Furthermore, I became proficient in testing and quality assurance, ensuring the reliability and functionality of the website. Lastly, I delved into the world of user experience and interface design, understanding the importance of creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces to enhance the overall experience for users.


    The challenges I faced include establishing a successful connection to the mysql database, configuring the database URL and ensuring proper access privileges. Designing an efficient and scalable database schema for hospitals and services was also a challenge, particularly in terms of establishing relationships between entities with multiple branches and sub-branches. Ensuring data integrity and validation still remains a challenge, requiring communication with administrative personnel for each institution. As the database and website grow in size, query optimization becomes important for efficient data retrieval and processing, including considering non-professional terms or symptoms for individual patients.
