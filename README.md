Project Name
    Patient Referral Website

Introduction

    Introducing a project that aims to make healthcare more accessible, I present an innovative solution that caters to the needs of health service providers. Created with utmost dedication, this platform was meticulously designed to simplify the arduous task of locating referral institutions offering higher level care. As the sole contributor to this project, my personal focus has been on developing a seamless and user-friendly interface, ensuring that health service providers can effortlessly search for institutions that align with their patients' specific health requirements. With this undertaking, my purpose is to empower healthcare professionals by streamlining the referral process, ultimately enhancing patient care and fostering collaboration within the healthcare community.

    As a medical doctor, I have witnessed patients and even fellow doctors express concern about the availability of targeted treatments. Our platform brings service providers and clients together, providing a centralized location for all parties to connect and collaborate.

    The development of the patient referral flask website was almost fully completed, with the remaining tasks expected to be finished in the near future. Progress was being tracked through a Trello board and its corresponding deadlines. A mysql database has been integrated into the project using sqlalchemy, which enhanced the storage and retrieval of hospital and service data. The final steps of integrating the data elements and deploying the website after thorough testing, ensuring effective communication with the database and resolving any issues or bugs were also undertaken.
